# Siefeldin Sobih
Hi, I'm Saif! I'm passionate about wildlife conservation through the lens of data and discovery, exploring how the invisible world of bacterial communities influences animal behavior and survival to shape the conservation strategies we need to protect species.

**Current Research**
My master's focuses is on the endangered rock iguanas across the Bahamas, investigating how both anthropogenic impacts from varying tourism rates, which impacts what Iguanas eat, and reproductive seasonal changes, and how both affect different subspecies and sexes. This is done by examining how these factors influence microbiome composition and overall physiological health. The insights that are reveled from this research will offer insights on how to better conserve these iguanas.

**My Methodology**
I work at the intersection of computational biology and field research, using statistical modeling and machine learning to transform complex datasets into actionable conservation insights. There's something truly exciting about discovering patterns in data that can make a real difference for wildlife in their natural habitats.

I have been growing and experiencing with the following programming languages: R, Python, Bash, Nextflow.

**Teaching & Outreach**
As Outreach Officer and Teaching Assistant in Utah State University's Biology Department, I spend a considerable amount of time sharing the excitement of science with students and community members of science unwrapped of all ages. Building science literacy and helping people connect with research is just as rewarding, as conducting the research itself, if not much more.

**What Drives Me**
Impact is at the heart of everything I do, I want to leave this world with the most positive long-lasting impact on those who will come after us, whether it may be research that I have done, software I helped develop, insights I shared about wildlife, or students that I have taught.

While I appreciate routine tasks from time to time, at work I prefer challenging new tasks that challenge me to grow! Whether I'm analyzing a new dataset, mentoring a student to success, or anything else, I want every project to push my limits.

Thanks for taking the time to explore my work. I hope you enjoy getting to know the research and passion behind it! Don'te hesitate to email me with any questions you have or any opportunities.
