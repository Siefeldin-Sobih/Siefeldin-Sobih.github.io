Hi, I'm Saif! I'm passionate about wildlife conservation through the lens of data and discovery. My research explores how bacterial communities influences animal behavior and survival, shaping the conservation strategies we need to protect species.

I work at the intersection of computational biology and field research, using statistical modeling and machine learning to turn complex datasets into actionable insights. There's something exciting about finding patterns in data that can actually make a difference for wildlife in the wild.

As the Outreach Officer and Teaching Assistant in Utah State University's Biology Department, I spend a lot of time sharing the excitement of science with students and community members of all ages. Building science literacy and helping people connect with research is just as rewarding as the research itself.

What really drives me is impact. Whether I'm analyzing a new dataset, mentoring a student to success, or tackling a challenging problem, I want every project to push boundaries and create positive change. I thrive on variety and growth, always looking for work that challenges me while contributing to stronger conservation efforts and more connected communities.
